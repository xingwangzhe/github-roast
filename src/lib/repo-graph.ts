/**
 * Pure helpers that turn a developer's profile snapshot into a *repo graph* —
 * the normalized project layer that promotes repositories to first-class,
 * queryable entities alongside the developer-centric `scores` / `developer_facets`
 * tables.
 *
 * Two kinds of node come out of one scan:
 *   - `owner` links — the developer's own notable projects (from `top_repos`,
 *     which the crawler already narrows to original + attributed-original work,
 *     forks excluded and capped at 10). These carry rich metadata (stars,
 *     language, topics, description), so they seed the project page's info card.
 *   - `contributor` links — popular OSS the developer has materially worked on
 *     (from `impact_repos`, i.e. the contribution graph). Same star floor as the
 *     `repo` discovery facet so the two stay in sync; metadata is sparse here
 *     (impact_repos only carries name + stars + commits + prs), filled in later
 *     when a repo's actual owner is scanned.
 *
 * Side-effect free and dependency-light (mirrors {@link ./facets}), so it's
 * trivially unit-tested and reused by both the fire-and-forget write path in
 * `recordProfileSnapshot` and the one-off repo-graph backfill. The DB layer turns
 * the returned nodes/links into `repos` + `repo_developers` rows.
