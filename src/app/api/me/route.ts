/**
 * Lightweight session probe for the client navbar / login nudge.
 *
 * The shared chrome (Navbar, LoginNudge) used to read the session via `auth()`
 * directly in the server render tree, which reads cookies and so opted EVERY
 * page out of static/ISR caching — including the homepage. Isolating that cookie
 * read into this dedicated API route lets the pages prerender + serve from the
 * CDN, while the navbar fills in the avatar/login state client-side from here.
 *
 * Returns the GitHub handle + avatar when signed in, plus whether the user has a
 * scored profile (drives the "my profile" vs "judge self" link). Always 200 with
 * `{ user: null }` when unconfigured or signed out, so the client logic is simple.
